Version 1.3 - April 3, 2025
- Upgraded YOLO from v8 to v11 (models/yolo11x.pt)
- Added full command-line support using --folder and --config flags.
- load_config() now accepts an optional path and defaults to config.yaml.
- All major config options moved to YAML:
  - supported_exts
  - chunk_size
  - model_name
  - yolo_model_path
  - recursive
  - write_exif
  - max_tags, min_tag_length
- setup_yolo() moved outside of process_folder() for better reuse.
- Removed unused imports and cleaned import structure.
- supported_exts now correctly lowercased and validated.
- Prints supported_exts and target folder on launch for debugging.
- Added fallback defaults if supported_exts is not found in config.
- Added recursive flag handling for non-recursive mode.
- Folder walk now prints folder names and file counts being scanned.
- Skipped folders now report if tagger_log.txt exists.
- Improved "Original mode" logging to display "Greyscale" instead of "L".
- RAM and GPU usage now logged at folder level, not per image.
- Additional checks to ensure folders aren't skipped silently.
- Cleaned up multiple error messages and user-facing logs.
